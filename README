The whole training steps has been combined into one notebook, called Training.ipynb.
In order to run the models themselves you can open Run.ipynb which contains instructions on
how to load the model, and apply them on the dataset.

The data preparation step was done over many notebooks and required a lot of experimentation.
To describe the whole process would be way redundant, and uninteresting. Nevertheless, the
notebooks for that are called data_prep_1, data_prep_2, and data_prep_3 in the work/ folder.
